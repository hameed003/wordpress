2. earlier we were totally dependent on WordPress theme to develop a website and we cannot customize it flexibly and we have to use the basic editing features of the theme which are already defined or else we have to hire a web developer to customize the theme according to our need, and then later the page builder came in to the picture and it gives the full control to the users to customize their website according to their needs, and now the users are able to customize header, footer, menu and anything else with page builder, and now we can choose any theme and rebuild our website from scratch with the help of page builder like Elementor, Divi , Gutenberg etc.
